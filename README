My custom Vagrantfile to package with boxes I create.

Included addons

  * vagrant puppet <command>

    - module_add NAME     # Generates a puppet module structure in ./modules/NAME
      
      The template that is used to generate the init.pp file is 
      located in in the .templates/ folder: module_init.tt


  * vagrant config

    - multivm_gen         # Generates a multivm env with every available box.

      The file name will be MultiVMVagrantfile. After generating,
      an example on how to include it in your Vagrantfile will be 
      presented. By default I comment it out (disabling it).

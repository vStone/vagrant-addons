| Introduction    |
+-----------------+

My custom Vagrantfile to package with boxes I create.

+-----------------+
| Instructions    |
+-----------------+

To use these, put the vagrant-addons folder in your vagrant project folder and
add the following lines to your Vagrantfile:

  ## Enable the addons.
  load File.expand_path('../.addons/Vagrantaddons', __FILE__)


+-----------------+
| Included addons |
+-----------------+

* vagrant puppet <command>

  - module_add NAME     # Generates a puppet module structure in ./modules/NAME
    
    The template that is used to generate the init.pp file is 
    located in in the .templates/ folder: module_init.tt


* vagrant config

  - multivm_gen         # Generates a multivm env with every available box.

    The file name will be MultiVMVagrantfile. After generating,
    an example on how to include it in your Vagrantfile will be 
    presented. By default I comment it out (disabling it).
